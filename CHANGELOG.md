# Change log

All notable changes to the LaunchDarkly Ruby SDK will be documented in this file. This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org).

## [2.0.0] - 2016-08-08
### Added
- Support for multivariate feature flags. In addition to booleans, feature flags can now return numbers, strings, dictionaries, or arrays via the `variation` method.
- New `all_flags` method returns all flag values for a specified user.
- If streaming is disabled, the client polls for feature flag changes. By default, the client will poll LaunchDarkly 
every second for updates. The poll interval is configurable via `poll_interval`.
- New `secure_mode_hash` function computes a hash suitable for the new LaunchDarkly JavaScript client's secure mode feature.
- Support for extremely large feature flags. When a large feature flag changes, the stream will include a directive to fetch the updated flag.

### Changed
- You can now initialize the LaunchDarkly client with an optional timeout (specified in seconds). This will block initialization until the client has finished bootstrapping and is able to serve feature flags.
- The streaming implementation (`StreamProcessor`) uses [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid/celluloid) under the hood instead of [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine). The dependency on EventMachine has been removed.
- The `store` option has been renamed to `cache_store`.
- Offline mode can no longer be set dynamically. Instead, at configuration time, the `offline` parameter can be set to put the client in offline mode. It is no longer possible to dynamically change whether the client is online and offline (via `set_online` and `set_offline`). Call `offline?` to determine whether or not the client is offline.
- The `debug_stream` configuration option has been removed.
- The `log_timings` configuration option has been removed.

### Deprecated
- The `toggle` call has been deprecated in favor of `variation`.

### Removed
- `update_user_flag_setting` has been removed. To change user settings, use the LaunchDarkly REST API.
